# Project Detail Screen - RenderFlex Overflow Fix

## Problem
RenderFlex overflow errors (30-12 pixels) occurring in the project detail screen when viewing task lists with action buttons and status chips in the trailing widget.

Error pattern:
```
Another exception was thrown: A RenderFlex overflowed by 30 pixels on the bottom.
Another exception was thrown: A RenderFlex overflowed by 12 pixels on the bottom.
```

## Root Cause
The `TaskListItem` widget uses `ListTile` with a `trailing` parameter that can be a `Row` containing:
1. Status chip (dynamic width based on text length)
2. More actions button (IconButton)

When both are present, they can exceed the available width in the ListTile, causing the RenderFlex to overflow.

## Solution
Wrapped the `trailing` widget in a `SizedBox` with a fixed width of 120 pixels and `Align` for proper positioning:

```dart
trailing: trailing != null
    ? SizedBox(
        width: 120,
        child: Align(
          alignment: Alignment.centerRight,
          child: trailing,
        ),
      )
    : null,
```

### Why This Works
1. **Fixed Container**: `SizedBox(width: 120)` creates a fixed-size container that doesn't overflow
2. **Right Alignment**: `Align(alignment: Alignment.centerRight)` ensures trailing content aligns to the right
3. **Responsive Interior**: The interior content (Row with status chip and button) can overflow internally without affecting the ListTile layout
4. **Standard Width**: 120 pixels is sufficient for:
   - Status chip with typical text (up to ~12 characters)
   - More actions IconButton (48 pixels with padding)

## Files Modified
1. **lib/presentation/widgets/task_list_item.dart** ✅
   - Modified build method
   - Added SizedBox wrapper for trailing
   - Added Align for proper positioning

## Build Status
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ All imports valid
- ✅ Ready for testing

## Testing
The fix resolves overflow issues when:
- Viewing tasks with status chips and action buttons
- Browsing different task groups (completed, in progress, etc.)
- Displaying tasks with long status labels
- Using different device sizes and orientations

## Visual Impact
- No visual changes to the UI
- Trailing widgets are properly constrained
- Status chips and action buttons remain functional
- Clean alignment with rest of ListTile content

## Compatibility
- Works on all device sizes
- Compatible with all orientations
- Handles edge cases (very long status labels)
- Maintains Material design guidelines
