# 🔧 Dependency Fix Summary

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Issue
```
Because task_manager depends on web_socket_channel ^2.4.6 which doesn't match any
versions, version solving failed.
```

### Solution Applied
Updated `web_socket_channel` dependency from `^2.4.6` to `^3.0.3` in `pubspec.yaml`

**File Modified:** `pubspec.yaml`
```yaml
# Before:
web_socket_channel: ^2.4.6

# After:
web_socket_channel: ^3.0.3
```

### Additional Cleanup
- Removed unused import from `lib/presentation/providers/project_detail_provider.dart`
- Cleaned and reinstalled all dependencies with `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

## 💡 Notes

1. **Version Compatibility**: `web_socket_channel: ^3.0.3` is compatible with Dart 3.8+ (your project uses Dart 3.8.1)

2. **Pre-existing Warnings**: The 122 informational warnings are from existing code and can be addressed separately:
   - `deprecated_member_use` - Using deprecated Flutter APIs (withOpacity, etc.)
   - `use_build_context_synchronously` - BuildContext usage across async gaps
   - `curly_braces_in_flow_control_structures` - Code style issues

3. **Build Command**: When running `flutter run`, make sure you have a device connected or emulator running
