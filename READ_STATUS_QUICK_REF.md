# Read Status Integration - Quick Reference

## What Was Added

### 1. Automatic Read Detection on Scroll
When user scrolls through messages, any unread messages from OTHER users that come into view are automatically marked as read.

```dart
// New method in chat_conversation_screen.dart
void _markVisibleMessagesAsRead()
```

**Triggers**: 
- Every time user scrolls
- Calculates viewport boundaries
- Marks visible unread messages

### 2. API Integration
When messages are marked as read, they're synced to server:

```
POST /inbox/messages/read
Payload: { "message_ids": [101, 102] }
```

**Response**: Server acknowledges and broadcasts to all users

### 3. WebSocket Real-Time Updates
When other users read your messages, you get instant notifications:

```json
{
  "type": "read",
  "data": {
    "conversation_id": 123,
    "reader_id": 45,
    "message_ids": [101, 102]
  }
}
```

## User Experience Flow

```
User scrolls chat
       ↓
Visible unread messages detected
       ↓
API call: POST /inbox/messages/read
       ↓
Server marks messages as read
       ↓
Broadcast to all users (WebSocket)
       ↓
All users see read status update (✓✓)
```

## Implementation Details

### File: `chat_conversation_screen.dart`

**New Method**:
```dart
void _handleScroll() {
  // ... existing code ...
  _markVisibleMessagesAsRead();  // NEW
}

void _markVisibleMessagesAsRead() {
  // 1. Get messages from provider
  // 2. Calculate which are in viewport
  // 3. Filter for unread from OTHER users
  // 4. Call _markMessagesAsRead(messageIds)
}
```

**Key Points**:
- ✅ Only marks messages from OTHER users
- ✅ Only marks messages that are currently visible
- ✅ Only marks messages that are unread
- ✅ Batches multiple IDs in one API call
- ✅ No API calls for messages from current user

### File: `conversation_details_provider.dart`

**Existing Methods** (already implemented):
- `markMessagesAsRead()` - Calls API
- `handleMessagesRead()` - Processes WebSocket events

### File: `websocket_service.dart`

**Event Flow**:
```
Raw WebSocket → Decode → Parse → MessagesReadEvent → Broadcast
```

Type "read" automatically creates MessagesReadEvent from nested data

## Testing

### Automatic Test
1. Open chat with unread messages
2. Scroll to view a message
3. Check network tab - should see POST /inbox/messages/read
4. Message should show as read (if using read indicator)

### Real-Time Test  
1. Open same conversation in TWO windows
2. In window 1: Send message from another account
3. In window 2: View the message (auto-marks read)
4. In window 1: Should see read status update in real-time

## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Messages not marked as read | Not scrolling to view | Scroll down in chat |
| Read status not updating in real-time | WebSocket not connected | Check connection status |
| Only marks some messages | Viewport calculation | Messages outside viewport not marked |
| Own messages not marking | By design | Only marks OTHER users' messages |

## API Endpoints

```
POST /inbox/messages/read
├─ Request: { "message_ids": [101, 102] }
├─ Response: { "success": true, "marked_count": 2 }
└─ Errors: 400 (invalid IDs), 403 (unauthorized)
```

## Performance Notes

- **Frequency**: Called on every scroll event
- **Batching**: All visible messages in one API call
- **Throttling**: Not implemented yet (could optimize)
- **Impact**: Minimal - only fires when scrolling

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add debouncing to reduce API calls
- [ ] Show "read by" indicators with timestamps
- [ ] Track read receipts for each user
- [ ] Implement read-receipts UI
- [ ] Analytics on message engagement

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to disable this feature:
1. Comment out line in `_handleScroll()`:
   ```dart
   // _markVisibleMessagesAsRead();
   ```
2. Messages will still mark as read on chat open (existing behavior)
3. WebSocket will still broadcast read events
4. No data loss - feature is purely UX enhancement
