# ✅ WebSocket Authorization - Complete

## What Was Done

Implemented full WebSocket channel authorization that mirrors your user login authentication:

### Changes Made

**1. WebSocketManager** (`lib/core/managers/websocket_manager.dart`)
- ✅ Added `socketId` getter to expose socket ID
- This allows the mixin to access the socket ID needed for authorization

**2. WebSocketChatMixin** (`lib/presentation/mixins/websocket_chat_mixin.dart`)
- ✅ Implemented full `_authorizeChannel()` method
- ✅ Uses `/broadcasting/auth` endpoint
- ✅ Sends channel name + socket ID
- ✅ Includes bearer token authentication
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling (401, 403, etc.)
- ✅ Complete logging of every step

### How It Works

```
User Token + Socket ID
    ↓
POST /broadcasting/auth
    ├─ Authorization: Bearer {token}
    ├─ Body: { channel_name, socket_id }
    ↓
Backend Validates
    ↓
Returns: { auth: "signature" }
    ↓
Channel Subscription Confirmed
    ↓
Real-time Events Flow
```

## Next Steps

1. Add WebSocketManager to providers in `main.dart`
2. Use mixin in chat screen
3. Provide auth token when initializing WebSocket
4. Monitor logs during testing
