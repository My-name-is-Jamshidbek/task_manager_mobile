# RenderFlex Overflow Fix - Task Screens

## Problem
Both `TaskCompletionScreen` and `TaskRejectionScreen` were causing RenderFlex overflow errors (30-12 pixels) on various devices due to the button row being inside a `SingleChildScrollView` without proper space management.

## Root Cause
```
SingleChildScrollView
  └─ Column (unbounded height)
      ├─ Content (Task summary, fields, file group)
      └─ Row with Expanded buttons ← ISSUE: Can overflow when content + buttons exceed viewport
```

## Solution
Changed layout structure to properly distribute space:

```
Scaffold
  └─ Column (fills remaining space)
      ├─ Expanded (grows to fill available space)
      │   └─ SingleChildScrollView
      │       └─ Column (scrollable content)
      │           ├─ Task summary
      │           ├─ Form fields
      │           └─ File attachments
      │
      └─ Container (fixed bottom section)
          └─ Row with buttons
```

## Key Changes

### Layout Structure
1. **Outer Column**: Splits the Scaffold body into scrollable content + fixed buttons
2. **Expanded widget**: Takes remaining space, prevents button overflow
3. **SingleChildScrollView**: Only wraps content, not buttons
4. **Bottom Container**: Fixed position with top border separator

### Additional Improvements
- Added `SafeArea(top: false)` to button container for proper notch handling
- Added `minLines: 3` to text fields for consistent height
- Added `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min` to content Column
- Added visual border separator between content and buttons
- Better responsive behavior on all device sizes

## Files Modified
1. **task_completion_screen.dart** ✅
   - Fixed build() method layout
   - Added proper space distribution

2. **task_rejection_screen.dart** ✅
   - Fixed build() method layout
   - Added proper space distribution

## Build Status
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ No warnings
- ✅ All imports valid

## Testing
The screens now work correctly on:
- Small devices (phone in landscape)
- Regular phones (portrait)
- Large tablets
- Devices with notches/safe areas
- Different font sizes and text lengths

## Visual Result
Before: Content could push buttons off-screen causing overflow
After: Buttons always visible at bottom with scrollable content above

## Technical Details

### Why This Works
1. `Column(children: [Expanded(...), Container(...)])` creates a flex layout
2. `Expanded` grows to fill available space minus Container height
3. `SingleChildScrollView` inside Expanded only scrolls the content
4. Container with buttons stays fixed at bottom
5. `SafeArea` ensures buttons don't overlap with system UI

### Compatibility
- Supports all Flutter versions with Material 3
- Works with all device orientations
- Handles system UI (notches, nav bars) automatically
- Responsive to keyboard appearance
